[Ms. Pac-Man] Proposal
What is [Ms. Pac-Man]? <br><br>
<p>Ms. Pac-Man is a yellow circle character that eats little white circles in a maze. The goal is to eat all the white circles without being attacked (touched) by any one of the four ghost characters. Ms. Pac-Man can lose a max of three lives before the game resets. In addition to the white circles, there are larger items Ms. Pac-Man can eat that for a brief amount of time allow her to swallow the ghosts, which sends them back to the center of the maze. After all white dots have been eating, the user can progress to the next level. Each succesive level will see an increase in ghost speed and aggression. There will also be a point system that accounts for each white dot eaten. The score will be carried over into the successive levels for the ultimate goal of the user attaining a top score, which will be listed on the scoreboard.</p><br><br>

<u>Wireframe</u> <br><br>
(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

<u>Initial thoughts on game structure</u> <br><br>
<p>I think the biggest challenges will entail programming the ghosts' behavior, in terms of speed and agression (whether they chase Ms. Pac-Man or just move around randomly).</p><br><br> 

<u>Phases of Completion</u> <br><br>
<p>(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)</p><br><br>
